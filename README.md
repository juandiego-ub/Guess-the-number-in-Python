This is a code project did it in my Data Science Master.
It is a game coding in python where you can Play alone or with a partner. You have to guess a random number from 1 to 1000 in single player mode, and if you are playing with a partner, you have to write the number you want to guess.

This game has some interesting option such as select the difficult (how many tries you have to guess the number) and if you can guess the number your data going to be saved in an excel to be query,

For the code to works you only have to create an excel file that need to be read 

Something to improve (code that if you already have an excel file just read it and if not created it)
